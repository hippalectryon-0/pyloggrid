Congratulations on finishing the tutorial ðŸŽ‰ You are now equipped with the knowledge to use this numerical library to run simulations and analyze their outputs. But don't stop here, there's still a lot more to explore and learn.

The documentation provides a wide range of helper functions for tasks such as data analysis and plotting, as well as useful settings that can be used to further optimize your work. We highly recommend reviewing the complete documentation to take full advantage of this numerical library.

To help you get started, here are some recommended resources:

* :doc:`../documentation/doc_using_the_solver`
* :doc:`../autoapi/index`
